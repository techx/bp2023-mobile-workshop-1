## Cookie Clicker 2: Electric Boogaloo

Demo for Blueprint 2023's Mobile Dev Workshop 1! Created with Expo. Make sure
you have Node.js installed. Then you can run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/techx/bp2023-mobile-workshop-1 cookie-clicker-2
```

to clone the repository. This should create a folder called `cookie-clicker-2` in your current folder.
You can go into that folder with `cd` (change directory):

```sh
cd cookie-clicker-2
```

and then install dependencies with

```sh
npm install
```

which should take a while. Once it's done you can run

```sh
npx expo start --tunnel
```

and that should start the app! You can now scan the QR code on your phone.
